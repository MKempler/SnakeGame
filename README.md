# Snake Game

##A classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## Features

- Control a snake and guide it to eat food, growing longer with each successful consumption.
  
- Avoid collisions with the boundaries of the game window and the snake's own body.
  
- Score points for each food item consumed.
  
- The game ends when the snake hits a boundary or touches its own body.
  
- Randomly respawned food keeps the game challenging.

## Requirements

- Python3
  
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/MKempler/SnakeGame.git


## Install the required dependencies:

pip install pygame

## Usage
Run the game by executing the Python file:

python snake_game.py

Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's direction.

Guide the snake to consume the food items to score points.

Avoid collisions with the boundaries and the snake's own body.

The game ends when the snake collides with a boundary or itself.

The score is displayed during gameplay, and the game over screen shows the final score.
